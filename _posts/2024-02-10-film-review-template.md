# My Approach to Film Reviews

Before I start posting film reviews, I wanted to share how I approach analyzing and discussing movies.

## What I Look For

### Story & Writing
- Is the plot engaging?
- Are the characters well-developed?
- Does the dialogue feel natural?
- Are there interesting themes?

### Direction & Cinematography
- How does the visual style serve the story?
- Are there memorable shots or sequences?
- What's the pacing like?

### Performances
- Do the actors bring their characters to life?
- Are there standout performances?

### Technical Aspects
- Sound design and music
- Visual effects (if applicable)
- Editing

### Personal Impact
- Did the film make me feel something?
- Would I watch it again?
- Who would I recommend it to?

## My Rating System

I'll use a simple 5-star system:

| Rating | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Masterpiece - Must watch |
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Excellent - Highly recommended |
| ⭐⭐⭐ | Good - Worth watching |
| ⭐⭐ | Mediocre - Has issues |
| ⭐ | Poor - Not recommended |

## Spoiler Policy

> I'll always mark spoilers clearly and keep the main review spoiler-free when possible.
