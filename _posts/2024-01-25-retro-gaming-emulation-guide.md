# The Magic of Retro Gaming Through Emulation

There's something special about revisiting the games of our childhood - or discovering classics we never got to play. Emulation makes this possible on modern hardware.

## What is Emulation?

Emulation is the process of mimicking older gaming hardware on modern devices. This allows you to play games from consoles like:

- NES, SNES, N64
- Sega Genesis, Saturn, Dreamcast
- PlayStation 1, 2, PSP
- GameBoy, GBA, DS
- And many more!

## Popular Emulators

Here are some recommended emulators for various systems:

| System | Recommended Emulator |
|--------|---------------------|
| NES | Mesen, FCEUX |
| SNES | Snes9x, bsnes |
| N64 | Project64, Mupen64Plus |
| PS1 | DuckStation |
| PS2 | PCSX2 |
| GameBoy | mGBA |

## RetroArch - The All-in-One Solution

RetroArch deserves special mention. It's a frontend that uses "cores" (emulators) to run games from almost any system. Perfect if you want one unified interface.

## Legal Considerations

> **Important**: Always dump your own game ROMs from cartridges you own. Downloading copyrighted games you don't own is piracy.
