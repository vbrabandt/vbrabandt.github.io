## Hello there, welcome to my personal blog

### Again?

I used to have a GitHub Pages blog, but it wasn't maintained and due to personal reasons I didn't write much on it.

So I decided to redo everything and start from scratch. There will be old posts published (like this one), but with updates more accurate to current times.

### Who am I?

I'm Vincent Wutthisit Brabandt, a 20 year-old with several interesting hobbies and interests (and perhaps questionable life choices).

Some of my interests include:

- **Technology** - Tinkering with computers, exploring different operating systems (especially Linux), and breaking/fixing hardware
- **Music** - Playing guitar, music production, and diving deep into albums across various genres
- **Gaming** - Both modern and retro gaming, with a focus on gaming on Linux
- **Open Source** - Contributing to and advocating for open-source software and communities
- **Culture & Politics** - Understanding different perspectives, history, and how they shape our world

### Why did I create this site?

I created this site as an experiment and as a way to express myself without relying on social media. Most social media platforms in my opinion are no longer designed for long-form content anymore as they now usually prioritize short posts.

I wanted a place where I could write longer documentations, share my thoughts, and not be constrained by character limits or the algorithm.

### What to expect?

I don't have everything planned out, but here are some topics I've been writing about and plan to continue exploring:

- **Computer Hardware & Tech**
  - Hardware reviews (keyboards, controllers, etc.)
  - Computer hardware repair and maintenance
  - Tech experiences and modifications
  - Operating system reviews (Linux, macOS, Windows)
  - Software recommendations and setups
- **Gaming**
  - Gaming hardware reviews
  - Video game reviews and analyses
  - Gaming on Linux experiences
- **Personal Experiences**
  - My tech equipment and daily driver setups
  - Opinion pieces and cultural commentary
- **Films/TV Shows**
  - Film and TV show reviews/analyses
  - Anime reviews/analyses
- **Music**
  - Album and song reviews/analyses (I've already started a "Music for the Month" series)
  - Musical equipment reviews
  - Music production insights

## About This Website

### Why did I choose GitHub Pages + Jekyll instead of another service?

Well firstly, I confess I can't afford a personal domain yet, so that explains why I'm using GitHub Pages (plus I really like the openness of GitHub and open-source).

I admit I have no experience in UI design (& I'm sorry, but I don't want to ever get into HTML/CSS). I just want a simple blog-style site with a minimalist kind of feel, but I found Squarespace/Wix to be designed more for portfolios and businesses. I once had a WordPress site, but I didn't enjoy its editor (yes, I'm that lazy).

GitHub Pages with Jekyll allows me to write posts in simple Markdown, version control everything with Git, and use beautiful pre-made themes (like [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/)) without touching HTML/CSS.

My plan is to maintain this blog on GitHub Pages, and one day I might create a separate portfolio/CV website on Squarespace if needed.

### Features

This blog includes:

- **Privacy-Friendly Analytics** - Using [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) to track page views
- **Comment System** - Powered by [Giscus](https://giscus.app/), which uses GitHub Discussions
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** - You can install this blog as an app on your device
