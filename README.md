My personal blog where I write about stuff.

Built with [jekyll-theme-chirpy][chirpy] by [cotes2020].

## Why did I create this site?

I intended to create this site as an experiment and as a way to express myself without relying on social media, most social media sites in my opinion are no longer designed for long posts anymore.

>TLDR; basically it's a personal blog

## Why did I choose Github pages + Jekyll instead of another service?

Well firstly, I confess I can't afford a personal domain yet, so that explains why I'm using Github pages (plus I really like the openness of Github/Open-source).

I admit I have no experience at UI design (& I'm sorry but I don't want to ever get into HTML/CSS), I just want a simple blog style site with a minimalist kinda feel, but I found Squarespace/Wix to be designed more for portfolios and businesses, I once had a Wordpress site, but I didn't enjoy it's editor.
